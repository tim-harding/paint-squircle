# Squircle

The smoothest CSS squircles south of Saskatchewan.
Powered by superellipses and CSS Houdini ðŸª„.

## Usage

See `example/index.html` for a barebones library demo.
First, initialize the library.

```js
import { register } from "superellipse-squircle/index.mjs";
import "superellipse-squircle/index.css"; // Or link it in your HTML

register("superellipse-squircle/worklet.min.js");
```

Note that the worklet is not a JavaScript module and your bundler won't know to
include it automatically. Make sure it's included in your build and that the
worklet path matches the route it is served from.

Elements with the `squircle` class will draw as squircles or fall back to
ordinary rounded rectangles on browsers that don't support the Paint API. At
the time of writing, only Chromium-based browsers work.

```html
<div
  class="squircle"
  style="
    --squircle-radius: 1rem;
    --squircle-fill: black;"
></div>
```

These properties control the squircle drawing.

| Property                  | Equivalent         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `--squircle-radius`       | `border-radius`    |
| `--squircle-fill`         | `background-color` |
| `--squircle-border-width` | `border-width`     |
| `--squircle-border-color` | `border-color`     |

To reduce the verbosity, you can alias the property names in your CSS. For
example, to use `--radius` instead of `--squircle-radius`:

```css
.squircle {
  --squircle-radius: var(--radius);
}
```
